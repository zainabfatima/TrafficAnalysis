# TrafficAnalysis

This project performs real-time and video-based traffic analysis using object detection and tracking. The system counts vehicles in defined lanes or zones and tracks their movements using the DeepSORT algorithm and YOLOv4.

## üîß Features

- Real-time vehicle detection from webcam or video file
- Vehicle counting based on predefined lane or zone crossings
- Multiple analysis modes using DeepSORT for accurate tracking
- Easy zone/lane configuration via GUI

## üìÅ Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `lane_analysis_realtime.py` | Runs lane-based vehicle counting using live webcam stream. |
| `lane_analysis_save.py` | Same as above but saves the analyzed video to file. |
| `lane_analysis_deepsort_realtime.py` | Real-time lane tracking using DeepSORT object tracking. |
| `lane_analysis_deepsort_save.py` | DeepSORT version with saving output to video. |
| `Create Zones.py` | GUI tool to define custom counting zones/lanes in a frame. |
| `utils.py` | Helper functions used in counting and visualization (e.g., counting lines, bounding boxes). |
| `sort.py` | The core DeepSORT tracking algorithm implementation. |
| `requirements.txt` | List of Python libraries required to run the project. |
| `classes.txt` | Class labels supported by YOLOv4 model (e.g., car, bus, truck). |
| `README.md` | Project documentation (you are reading it!). |
